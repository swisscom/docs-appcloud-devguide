Release date: 28.07.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service UI: tagging and bundling of requests

We have extended the Connectivity as a Service UI to include tagging of connectivity requests as well as adding a free-text description. In addition, we now enable the client to bundle several connectivity rules into one request.

#### Improve background job processing

We are constantly improving our background job processing framework to ensure a higher throughput of asynchronous jobs while making this mechanism more robust in case of single job failures.

#### UI usability improvements

We have improved the usability of our UI in accordance with the results from our periodical usability tests. One improvement is that users with many billing accounts can now hide canceled accounts in the navigation. Furthermore, we have made the display of the billing history clearer by giving the current month a more prominent appearance.

#### Simplify configuration of API component

We have enhanced our defaults for service and buildpack configuration data in order to simplify the rollout of new environments for us as a cloud provider. It turns out that this data rarely varies between environments and if it does it can be overridden configuratively.

#### Other UI improvements and fixes

We have provided a various other UI improvements and bug fixes.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided a number of API improvements and bug fixes.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version v268 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v268)) with Diego version 1.23.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.23.0)).

## <a id='6.5.11'></a> 6.5.11

Release date: 5.7.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service API: tagging and bundling of requests

We have extended the Connectivity as a Service API to include tagging of connectivity requests as well as adding a free-text description. Furthemore, we have added the option to search connectivity requests by tag or status. In addition, we now enable the client to bundle several connectivity rules into one request and we allow the security_officer role to create requests. The latter is useful in automation scenarios where this role is given to a central technical user.

#### Buildpack administration via API enabled

Administrative operations on buildpacks were until now reserved to our own operators. We now provide a buildpack_admin user role which can be granted via the UAA and which entitles the user to create, read, update and delete the buildpacks used as defaults by the cloud instance.

#### Isolation segment operations exposed via API

In order to enable various features which use the Isolation Segment concept offered by the Cloud Foundry v3 API, we are exposing these endpoint on our API.

#### Improve background job processing

We are constantly improving our background job processing framework to ensure a higher throughput of asynchronous jobs while making this mechanism more robust in case of single job failures.

#### UI usability improvements

We have improved the usability of our UI in accordance with the results from our periodical usability tests. We now apply consistent sorting of entities where applicable. Furthermore, we have improved the performance of the quick jump feature when dealing with a large number of accounts, orgs and spaces. We have also added three minor features for making work with the UI more efficient when dealing with app environment variables, ssl certificates and domains.

#### Other UI improvements and fixes

We have provided a various other UI improvements and bug fixes.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided a number of API improvements and bug fixes.

### Billing and Portal

#### Creation and management of technical users via the UI

After having implemented the API part in the last release we now enable arbitrary users to create technical users via the UI for use in tooling such as a CI / CD pipeline. Technical users are created at space level and are automatically deleted when they are no longer associated with any space.

#### Live status information for services (Part I)

We are increasing the value of our UI by making certain suitable information available to the user in a live way, without requiring a page reload. As a first step in this direction we are showing service status changes as they happen.

#### Improved user invitation and notifications

We have made the email messages which users receive when they are invited visually more appealing by using modern HTML email standards.

#### Connectivity as a service improvements

We have improved the handling of connectivity request failures in the API and the UI.

#### Health checks configurable via UI

We are constantly evaluating which CLI features to also expose in the UI. As a part of this initiative we have decided to enable the user to configure health checks when pushing apps via the UI.

#### Improved monitoring of certificate renewal process

We have improved our internal monitoring of the automated renewal of self-service certificates. This will allow us to react more quickly to problems which sporadically arise due to the highly distributed nature of this process.

#### UI updated to new Swisscom SDX styling

We have adapted pictograms and info boxes to SDX, the new Swisscom design guideline for web applications.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided two small API improvements.

#### UI improvements and fixes

## <a id='6.3.0'></a> 6.3.0

Release date: 01.5.2017

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version V257 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v257)) with Diego version 1.12.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.12.0)).

## <a id='6.2.0'></a> 6.2.0

Release date: 20.4.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### More flexible buildpack management

In virtual private environments it is desirable to allow certain users to manage buildpacks without giving them superuser permissions. Hence, we have introduced a new role buildpack_admin which can be assigned to any user and allows them to update non-system buildpacks.

#### API for technical user creation

We have added an option to enable arbitrary users to create technical users for use in tooling such as a CI/CD pipeline. Technical users are currently created at space level and are deleted when they are no longer associated with any space.

#### Enable credit card update in status "cancellation pending"

Until now users did not have permission to update the credit card information when their account was in status "cancellation pending". In particular, this led to the situation, that if an account could not be cancelled due to an invalid credit card (e.g. due to expiry), the user could update the credit card to rectify the situation. This has now been corrected.

#### Improved user invitation and notifications

We have made the UI for inviting users to orgs and spaces easier to understand. Furthermore we have improved the email messages which users receive when they are invited.

#### Improved user view for support users

Inactive users are often irrelevant when looking up users in support scenarios. We have added the option to filter out inactive users from the user list for support users.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of UI issues.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided a fix for an API issue.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version V254 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v254)) with Diego version 1.10.1 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.10.1)).

## <a id='6.1.0'></a> 6.1.0

Release date: 16.3.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service: zone assignment made optional

Until now, security group requests could only be created in spaces belonging to orgs which have a security zone assigned. We have now removed this restriction to enable users to be more flexible with respect to point in time at which they define the zone assignment.

#### Improved info boxes in Developer Console

On many screens of the Developer Console we use info boxes to guide the user with respect to options and restrictions. More experienced users have expressed the wish to remove these info boxes. Hence, we have added an option to close individual boxes persistently and to reset the state of the UI to make all boxes appear again.

#### Improved UI for support users

As our user base and the number of instances of our cloud grows, the need for support functionality increases. We have added pagination of the list of all users in the system, available to support users. Furthermore, we have enabled support users to search users by name in addition to the username and the email address.

#### Improved scaling limit for apps in Developer Console

Until now, scaling an app's memory in the Developer Console was limited to a hardcoded value of 2GB. We have removed this unnecessary restriction and instead have linked the memory scaling limit of apps to the instance_memory_limit value of the organisation quota.

#### Show service events in Developer Console

So far, only the app detail view of the Developer Console featured an events tab. We have now also added an events tab to the service details.

#### Improved validation of fully qualified domain names for SSL certificates

Our F5-based entry server currently only allows CSR generation for fully qualified domain names with up to 63 octets. For longer names the generation process fails and causes the corresponding certificate request to fail intransparently. To make this restriction more transparent, we have added a validation to our API to disallow longer FQDNs.

#### Custom service parameters during service creation

We have prepared the service creation wizard for services which need to collect custom parameters during the creation step.

#### Make data loading in UI more flexible

We have improved the way data from the backend is propagated through the component hierarchy in our UI.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number for UI issues.

## <a id='6.0.0'></a> 6.0.0

Release date: 16.3.2017 (deployed with 6.1.0)

### Cloud Foundry Core

## <a id='5.7.0'></a> 5.7.0

Release date: 6.3.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service: added UI support for additional protocols

Until now, security group requests and default groups supported only the protocols 'tcp' and 'udp'. We have now extended support for 'icmp' and the option 'all' to the UI.

#### Improved email notifications

Invitation emails for spaces, organizations and billing accounts were confusing when the targeted user was already known to the inviter as invitations to new entities were notified in the same way as role changes. We have changed this behaviour to distinguish between new roles and changed roles.

#### Support for long invoice lists

With every month of operation, the list of invoices in the account screen of each account becomes longer. We have implemented infinite scrolling to avoid loading all invoices in the UI when the list is too long.

#### Improved user search for support users

When support users are looking for a particular user, they can now use first and last names in addition to the username and the email address.

#### More robust automatic renewal process for ssl certificates

In some cases the authentication callback from Let's Encrypt for an automatic certificate renewal reaches our cloud too late and the corresponding renewal process becomes stuck, requiring a manual intervention. We have increased the amount of time for which we wait for this callback.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of UI issues.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of API issues.

## <a id='5.6.0'></a> 5.6.0

We have added the option for a service to include a service-specific dashboard which can be used to configure the service at the time of provisioning or during its operation.

#### Connectivity as a Service: improvements

We are constantly improving the Connectivity as a Service fetaures, as our experience with these features broadens. In particular, we have added a detail view for connectivity requests.

#### Display routes services in Developer Console

We have taken a first step to integrate the concept of route services in the Developer Console by displaying information about them in the service tiles and service details.

#### Fixed an XSS vulnerability in Developer Console

We discovered that error messages pointing to already existing names of orgs, spaces, services and apps were not properly sanitized and hence vulnerable to XSS attacks in the entity name. This vulnerability is now fixed.

#### Performance improvements

We have started a new campaign to further improve loading times in the Developer Console by maximizing parallel asynchronous data loading. We were already able to improve loading of space details, of the navigation tree and of permission in general. More improvements will follow in the next release.

#### Changed rules for resending invitations

Invitations can now be resent, if they were rejected.

#### Improved space role handling for non-managers

A user who is not manager of a space can now also remove roles for himself / herself. This was previously not permitted.

#### Enabled pushing of docker images over Developer Console

Docker images can now be pushed directly over the Developer Console. This was previously only possible via the CLI.

#### Usability improvements in Developer Console

We are constantly improving the usability of the Developer Console based on customer feedback as well as regular usability tests. In particular, we have improved the graph explaining the structure of an account, we have added syntax highlighting on code snippets and we have improved the quick search shortcut on Mac(⌘+k).

### Billing and Portal

#### Improved default apps

We have made improvements to the default apps which are pushed in the Developer Console, if no app code is provided.

#### Improvements of backup / restore of MongoDB instances

Several minor improvements have been made since backup / restore of MongoDB instances was launched in the previous release

#### Improved events on app detail

In case of an app crash we have improved error reporting on the events tab in the Developer Console. Furthermore, we have added custom symbols for more event types

#### Improved overview of service keys

The developer console is now correctly showing the service key count in the space summary

#### Improved CORS performance

In scenarios where the API is called by a browser client like the Developer Console, preflight OPTIONS requests can now be cached by the browser

#### V3 extensions of certificates available over API

We have added V3 extensions to the detail information available for certificates over the API

#### Consistent use of buttons

In the Developer Console we have improved usability by consistently using buttons for actions which change data and links for navigation

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version v237 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v237)) with Diego version 0.1476.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1476.0)).
This update fixes, belong many other improvements, the known issues with hanging dopplers and due that logs can not be received.

### Services

Update orchestration framework, should make single service instance provisioning slightly faster
Various other stability fixes in service management

Backup and restore of MongoDB single instances with up to 30 backups per service instance.

New DNS setup that fixes issues with temporary unresolvable services.

### Billing and Portal

#### Backup and restore for MongoDB service instances

Backup and restore of your MongoDB instances can now be performed through the Developer Console. On MongoDB service instances the user has a new tab for creating, restoring and deleting backups for that particular instance. Handling of the backup data is managed in a fully automated and transparent manner.

#### Extended quota management

We have extended the possibilities for managing quotas at org and space level. Organization quotas can now be assigned by users with organization manager permissions over the API. Furthermore, space quotas can be viewed in the Developer Console in an analogous way to organization quotas.

#### Improved handling for invitations

We have improved the way the users can handle their invitations. In particular, when the user follows the link to the Developer Console in an invitation email, the invitation is displayed in a modal, as soon as the user reaches the Developer Console.

#### Improved API performance when querying permissions

Permissions are typically queried heavily by UI clients which consume our API, like the Developer Console itself. To the benefit of such clients, we have improved the performance of the permissions endpoints on our API.

#### Improved display of certificates

The list of certificates in the sidebar of the space details has been reworked to improve readability by allowing the user to toggle the display of revoked certificates.

#### UI redesign extended to more screens

We have continued our effort to streamline the UI of the developer console. To this end we have made some stylistic changes to the push app wizard and to the app details screen.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version 233 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v233)) with Diego version 0.1461.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1461.0)):

- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0781 UAA Persistent XSS Vulnerability. The UAA OAuth approval pages are vulnerable to an XSS attack by specifying malicious java script content in either the OAuth scopes (SCIM groups) or SCIM group descriptions.
- v233 also includes a fix for CVE-2016-2165 - Loggregator Request URL Paths. 404 responses from Loggregator endpoints include the URL sent, and are vulnerable to an XSS attack.
- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0780 Cloud Controller Disk Quota Enforcement. It was discovered that Cloud Foundry does not properly enforce disk quotas in certain cases. An attacker could use an improper disk quota value to bypass enforcement and consume all the disk on DEAs/Diego Cells causing a potential denial of service for other applications.
- v233 has a potential for only delivering partial sets of log messages for an app, or to the firehose. This can happen if multiple Dopplers have restarted since the Traffic Controllers were deployed. If you suspect you are missing logs, the workaround is to restart the Traffic Controllers.
- v233 contains a performance regression in Gorouter introduced in v228. At low request volume, the issue is not observable; only at higher request volumes (such as a load test) is the regression evident. The regression was fixed in v234.
- v233 includes a change in cflinuxfs2 that removes support for libmysqlclient in favor of libmariadb. This will require a clearing of buildpack cache and a restaging of apps for the changes to take place.
