#### Known Issues
##### Service is provided by multiple service brokers

If you use space scoped service brokers, you must use the '-b <service-broker-name>' flag to create new services. This applies for every service in the marketplace.
If you do not provide this flag, the service creation fails with with an error message similar to the following:

```
Service 'task-scheduler' is provided by multiple service brokers. Specify a broker by using the '-b' flag.
```

As a workaround, provide the '-b' flag with the correct service broker name. For example:

```
cf cs task-scheduler free test -b task-scheduler
```
