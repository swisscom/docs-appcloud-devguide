Release date: 20.01.2025

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry cf-deployment v46.5.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v46.5.0)) with
Diego version v2.107.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.107.0)) and Capi version v1.200.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.200.0)).

#### Component releases which are divergent to cf-deployment v46.5.0:
- The diego release v2.107.0 is in use instead of v2.112.0 (diego version v2.109.0 - v2.112.0 with issues on platforms which supports multiple stacks, like we do with cflinuxfs3 and cfliunxfs4).<br> 
  If newer upcoming diego rleases will not solve this situation, then we will have to drop the support of the cflinuxfs3 stack on our platforms.<br> 
  Notes about the removal of the cflinuxfs3 stack has been announced since mid of 2023 (see paragraph "cflinuxfs4" further below also).<br>
  

#### Additional changes to mention:
- Gorouter will now properly emit standardised RFC5424 syslog messages instead of BSD-style (RFC3164) syslog messages.<br>

#### cflinuxfs4
- We advise users to migrate to the new stack for the upcoming removal of cflinuxfs3. (https://docs.developer.swisscom.com/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html)

**Attention:** We advise users to always read the buildpack release notes carefully for upcoming changes.

## <a id='2.46.x'></a> 2.46.x

Release date: 01.03.2023

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry cf-deployment v26.3.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v26.3.0)) with
Diego version v2.71.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.71.0)) and Capi version v1.144.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.144.0)).

#### cflinuxfs4 support added
- This platform release adds support for the cflinuxfs4 stack. We advise users to test the new stack for the upcoming switch from cflinuxfs3 to cflinuxfs4. (https://docs.developer.swisscom.com/devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html)

#### Java & PHP buildpack-based applications
- Please be advised that in one of the upcoming platform releases cflinuxfs4 version >1.x will be introduced. This release removes Python and Ruby from the stack which was previously needed for the Java and PHP buildpack. PHP buildpack releases v4.6.0 or higher and Java buildpack releases v4.55 or higher are supported on this new cflinuxfs4 stack version.

#### Additional changes to mention:

**Attention:** We advise users to always read the buildpack release notes carefully for upcoming changes.

 - **Ruby buildpack:** With this platform release we offer Ruby buildpack v1.9.2, which defaults to using Ruby version v3.x.
 Ruby v3.x includes some major differences which could lead to your app being not able to stage or compile anymore.

   **Note:** Ruby buildpacks still support the use of Ruby v2.7.x for the moment, until it is finally removed from the buildpack. Its removal is expected sometime in the near future (likely April 2023 due to its EOL).

## <a id='2.44.x'></a> 2.44.x

Release date: 05.01.2023

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry cf-deployment v24.1.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v24.1.0)) with
Diego version v2.70.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.70.0)) and Capi version v1.139.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.139.0)).

#### Component releases which are divergent to cf-deployment v24.1.0:
- Includes previous capi version v1.139.0 instead of v1.142.0 which would include a regression.


#### Additional changes to mention:

**Attention:** We advise users to always read the buildpack release notes carefully for upcoming changes. 

 - **Ruby buildpack:** v1.8.61 will be the last Ruby buildpack which defaults to use Ruby version 2.7.x and will be rolled out with this platform release version 2.44.x. 
Newer platform releases (>=2.45.x) will offer Ruby buildpack v1.9.0 or newer, which defaults to using Ruby version 3.x.
Ruby v3.x includes some major differences which could lead to your app being not able to stage or compile anymore. 
   
   **Please take care to properly test all your Ruby applications with the latest buildpack and Ruby v3.x in advance!**  
   Ruby buildpacks still support the use of Ruby v2.7.x for the moment, until it is finally removed from the buildpack. Its removal is expected sometime in the near future  (likely April 2023 due to its EOL).

Release date: 11.02.2022

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry cf-deployment v17.1.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v17.1.0)) with
Diego version v2.55.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.55.0)) and Capi version v1.123.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.123.0)).

Known Issues:

Update 11.02.2022:

Version 2.33.x of our platform release contains a known issue that can cause application traces to break.
Gorouter sets an invalid X-B3-SpanID header.
An issue with the Gorouter’s implementation of X-B3-SpanId and X-B3-TraceId headers can cause invalid span IDs 
to be set after updating the X-B3-TraceId header to the new 16-byte standard. 
As a result, some applications and libraries invalidate the X-B3-SpanId value, breaking traces of the application.
This issue introduced with routing-release v0.227.0 and v0.228.0 is used on our platform release 2.32.x.

An issue with the Gorouter’s implementation of X-B3-SpanId and X-B3-TraceId headers can cause invalid span IDs 
to be set after updating the X-B3-TraceId header to the new 16-byte standard. 
As a result, some applications and libraries invalidate the X-B3-SpanId value, breaking traces of the application.
This issue introduced with routing-release v0.227.0 and v0.228.0 is used on our platform release 2.32.x.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry cf-deployment v16.25.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v16.25.0)) with
Diego version v2.53.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.53.0)) and Capi version v1.119.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.119.0)).

Information update: 25.11.2021

After relasing this cloud-release it was detected that a limitation of max 1024 concurrent connections to the backend containers was introduced with 
cloud-release 2.29.x and with diego v2.53.0 already.

A new 2.30.x hotfix cloud-release uses diego v.2.54.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.54.0)) and solves this concourrent connections limitation (greater than 1024).

#### Known Issues
##### Service is provided by multiple service brokers

If you use space scoped service brokers, you must use the '-b <service-broker-name>' flag to create new services. This applies for every service in the marketplace.
If you do not provide this flag, the service creation fails with with an error message similar to the following:

```
Service 'task-scheduler' is provided by multiple service brokers. Specify a broker by using the '-b' flag.
```

As a workaround, provide the '-b' flag with the correct service broker name. For example:

```
cf cs task-scheduler free test -b task-scheduler
```
