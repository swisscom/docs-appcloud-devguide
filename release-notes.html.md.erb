Release date: 13.6.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### CLI version 6.26 support

As of version 6.26 the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI) makes use of some endpoints of the Cloud Controller v3 API. We have proxied the required endpoints for GET requests in our own API extension in order to support CLI versions higher than 6.26.

#### Status page integrated in UI

We now display the overall status of the cloud directly in the UI and have added a link from the UI to the status page to provide more detailed status information.

## <a id='6.3.28'></a> 6.3.28

Release date: 16.5.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Creation and management of technical users via the UI

After having implemented the API part in the last release we now enable arbitrary users to create technical users via the UI for use in tooling such as a CI / CD pipeline. Technical users are created at space level and are automatically deleted when they are no longer associated with any space.

#### Live status information for services (Part I)

We are increasing the value of our UI by making certain suitable information available to the user in a live way, without requiring a page reload. As a first step in this direction we are showing service status changes as they happen.

#### Improved user invitation and notifications

We have made the email messages which users receive when they are invited visually more appealing by using modern HTML email standards.

#### Connectivity as a service improvements

We have improved the handling of connectivity request failures in the API and the UI.

#### Health checks configurable via UI

We are constantly evaluating which CLI features to also expose in the UI. As a part of this initiative we have decided to enable the user to configure health checks when pushing apps via the UI.

#### Improved monitoring of certificate renewal process

We have improved our internal monitoring of the automated renewal of self-service certificates. This will allow us to react more quickly to problems which sporadically arise due to the highly distributed nature of this process.

#### UI updated to new Swisscom SDX styling

We have adapted pictograms and info boxes to SDX, the new Swisscom design guideline for web applications.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided two small API improvements.

#### UI improvements and fixes

## <a id='6.3.0'></a> 6.3.0

Release date: 01.5.2017

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version V257 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v257)) with Diego version 1.12.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.12.0)).

## <a id='6.2.0'></a> 6.2.0

Release date: 20.4.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### More flexible buildpack management

In virtual private environments it is desirable to allow certain users to manage buildpacks without giving them superuser permissions. Hence, we have introduced a new role buildpack_admin which can be assigned to any user and allows them to update non-system buildpacks.

#### API for technical user creation

We have added an option to enable arbitrary users to create technical users for use in tooling such as a CI/CD pipeline. Technical users are currently created at space level and are deleted when they are no longer associated with any space.

#### Enable credit card update in status "cancellation pending"

Until now users did not have permission to update the credit card information when their account was in status "cancellation pending". In particular, this led to the situation, that if an account could not be cancelled due to an invalid credit card (e.g. due to expiry), the user could update the credit card to rectify the situation. This has now been corrected.

#### Improved user invitation and notifications

We have made the UI for inviting users to orgs and spaces easier to understand. Furthermore we have improved the email messages which users receive when they are invited.

#### Improved user view for support users

Inactive users are often irrelevant when looking up users in support scenarios. We have added the option to filter out inactive users from the user list for support users.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of UI issues.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided a fix for an API issue.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version V254 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v254)) with Diego version 1.10.1 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.10.1)).

## <a id='6.1.0'></a> 6.1.0

Release date: 16.3.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service: zone assignment made optional

Until now, security group requests could only be created in spaces belonging to orgs which have a security zone assigned. We have now removed this restriction to enable users to be more flexible with respect to point in time at which they define the zone assignment.

#### Improved info boxes in Developer Console

On many screens of the Developer Console we use info boxes to guide the user with respect to options and restrictions. More experienced users have expressed the wish to remove these info boxes. Hence, we have added an option to close individual boxes persistently and to reset the state of the UI to make all boxes appear again.

#### Improved UI for support users

As our user base and the number of instances of our cloud grows, the need for support functionality increases. We have added pagination of the list of all users in the system, available to support users. Furthermore, we have enabled support users to search users by name in addition to the username and the email address.

#### Improved scaling limit for apps in Developer Console

Until now, scaling an app's memory in the Developer Console was limited to a hardcoded value of 2GB. We have removed this unnecessary restriction and instead have linked the memory scaling limit of apps to the instance_memory_limit value of the organisation quota.

#### Show service events in Developer Console

So far, only the app detail view of the Developer Console featured an events tab. We have now also added an events tab to the service details.

#### Improved validation of fully qualified domain names for SSL certificates

Our F5-based entry server currently only allows CSR generation for fully qualified domain names with up to 63 octets. For longer names the generation process fails and causes the corresponding certificate request to fail intransparently. To make this restriction more transparent, we have added a validation to our API to disallow longer FQDNs.

#### Custom service parameters during service creation

We have prepared the service creation wizard for services which need to collect custom parameters during the creation step.

#### Make data loading in UI more flexible

We have improved the way data from the backend is propagated through the component hierarchy in our UI.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number for UI issues.

## <a id='6.0.0'></a> 6.0.0

Release date: 16.3.2017 (deployed with 6.1.0)

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version V251 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v251)) with Diego version 1.5.4 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.5.4)).
With this Cloud Foundry version the minimum required cf-cli version is v6.22.2.

## <a id='5.7.0'></a> 5.7.0

Release date: 6.3.2017

### Billing and Portal

#### Connectivity as a Service: added UI support for additional protocols

Until now, security group requests and default groups supported only the protocols 'tcp' and 'udp'. We have now extended support for 'icmp' and the option 'all' to the UI.

#### Improved email notifications

Invitation emails for spaces, organizations and billing accounts were confusing when the targeted user was already known to the inviter as invitations to new entities were notified in the same way as role changes. We have changed this behaviour to distinguish between new roles and changed roles.

#### Support for long invoice lists

With every month of operation, the list of invoices in the account screen of each account becomes longer. We have implemented infinite scrolling to avoid loading all invoices in the UI when the list is too long.

#### Improved user search for support users

When support users are looking for a particular user, they can now use first and last names in addition to the username and the email address.

#### More robust automatic renewal process for ssl certificates

In some cases the authentication callback from Let's Encrypt for an automatic certificate renewal reaches our cloud too late and the corresponding renewal process becomes stuck, requiring a manual intervention. We have increased the amount of time for which we wait for this callback.

#### UI improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of UI issues.

#### API improvements and fixes

We have provided fixes for a number of API issues.

## <a id='5.6.0'></a> 5.6.0

In particular, we were able to entirely eliminate the need for calls from the billing component back to the API component. These improvements are not directly noticeable to the end-user but they are making our components more stable and are eliminating a substantial amount of configuration and maintenance overhead.

#### Prepared interactive service provisioning

We have added the option for a service to include a service-specific dashboard which can be used to configure the service at the time of provisioning or during its operation.

#### Connectivity as a Service: improvements

We are constantly improving the Connectivity as a Service fetaures, as our experience with these features broadens. In particular, we have added a detail view for connectivity requests.

#### Display routes services in Developer Console

We have taken a first step to integrate the concept of route services in the Developer Console by displaying information about them in the service tiles and service details.

#### Fixed an XSS vulnerability in Developer Console

We discovered that error messages pointing to already existing names of orgs, spaces, services and apps were not properly sanitized and hence vulnerable to XSS attacks in the entity name. This vulnerability is now fixed.

#### Performance improvements

We have started a new campaign to further improve loading times in the Developer Console by maximizing parallel asynchronous data loading. We were already able to improve loading of space details, of the navigation tree and of permission in general. More improvements will follow in the next release.

### Cloud Foundry Core

Cloud Foundry version 233 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v233)) with Diego version 0.1461.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1461.0)):

- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0781 UAA Persistent XSS Vulnerability. The UAA OAuth approval pages are vulnerable to an XSS attack by specifying malicious java script content in either the OAuth scopes (SCIM groups) or SCIM group descriptions.
- v233 also includes a fix for CVE-2016-2165 - Loggregator Request URL Paths. 404 responses from Loggregator endpoints include the URL sent, and are vulnerable to an XSS attack.
- v233 includes a fix for CVE-2016-0780 Cloud Controller Disk Quota Enforcement. It was discovered that Cloud Foundry does not properly enforce disk quotas in certain cases. An attacker could use an improper disk quota value to bypass enforcement and consume all the disk on DEAs/Diego Cells causing a potential denial of service for other applications.
- v233 has a potential for only delivering partial sets of log messages for an app, or to the firehose. This can happen if multiple Dopplers have restarted since the Traffic Controllers were deployed. If you suspect you are missing logs, the workaround is to restart the Traffic Controllers.
- v233 contains a performance regression in Gorouter introduced in v228. At low request volume, the issue is not observable; only at higher request volumes (such as a load test) is the regression evident. The regression was fixed in v234.
- v233 includes a change in cflinuxfs2 that removes support for libmysqlclient in favor of libmariadb. This will require a clearing of buildpack cache and a restaging of apps for the changes to take place.
